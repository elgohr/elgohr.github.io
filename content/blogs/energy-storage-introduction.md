## Introduction
In the quest for more sustainable and cost-effective energy solutions, combining a home battery storage system with a photovoltaic (PV) solar system and a dynamic energy contract offers a powerful way to optimize energy costs. This integrated approach allows homeowners to generate their own renewable energy, store it for later use, and take advantage of real-time fluctuations in electricity prices.  

The PV system generates clean electricity during sunny periods, while the battery stores excess energy that would otherwise go unused. By utilizing a dynamic energy contract, which adjusts the price of electricity based on supply and demand throughout the day, homeowners can ensure that they use the most affordable energy when it's available, either drawing from the grid or from their battery storage.  

This synergy enables greater energy independence, reduced reliance on the grid, and significant savings on electricity bills. It also helps to reduce the environmental footprint by maximizing the use of renewable energy while minimizing peak-hour energy consumption.  

With that in mind I bought a Fronius PV system capable of generating 13 kWp and an battery storage capable of buffering 10 kWh.  

To minimize our housholds energy costs i got down the rabbit whole of using the battery to the very extend.  
Beside the question of whether it would be good to "survive" higher dynamic energy prices via battery, I took a look into loading the battery on cheap times and creating an optimal schedule for loading/unloading.  
Today people would call it [HEMS](https://senec.com/de/magazin/hems).  
On the way I came around the question "Could I buy cheap and sell later?" (disclaimer: no).  

This series will be continued from time to time.
